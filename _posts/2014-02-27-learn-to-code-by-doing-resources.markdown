**This is a list of all of the different websites and forums that I’ve found useful. If you know of any that I don’t here, please feel free to comment or hit me up on twitter and I’ll be happy to add them.**

###Online Courses
######These courses require no prior knowledge about computer science.

[Harvard’s CS50 ](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

* Introductory to computer science. Starts learning in C, then moves on to web programming with PHP, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

[Coursera](http://coursera.org)

* I didn’t want to list a specific class because Coursera’s course catalog is constantly changing, but if you search for CS you’re bound to find a class or two that you’ll find useful. Reddit user dhawal has some great posts of free online classes.

###Online Tutorials

[Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)

* Great for new learners to get used to syntax and start typing code.

[Learn Code the Hard Way](http://learncodethehardway.org/)

* Great tutorials by Zed Shaw for Python, Ruby, SQL, C and REGEX. Great if you want more in depth knowledge than Codecademy.

[Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/)

* Step by step guide to get you making your first Rails app. I’d do at least one (if not more) of the things previously listed here before jumping into this.
