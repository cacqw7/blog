###### *Batches are only available in [Sidekiq Pro](http://sidekiq.org/products/pro)*

[Church360ยบ Members](http://www.concordiatechnology.org/church360/members) lets users send end-of-year statement emails to their entire congregation. Some of our users could send be sending upwards of 3,000 emails at one time. We wanted a way to give the user a progress bar for the jobs instead of just notifying them once they are all sent.

End result using [Sidekiq Batches](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Batches) and [progressbar.js](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/progressbar.js):

#### Batches

From the [docs](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki), a batch is

> a collection of jobs which can be monitored as a group. You can create a set of jobs to execute in parallel and then execute a callback when all the jobs are finished.

This is our current code for creating jobs:
{% highlight ruby %}
selected_people.pluck(:id).each do |person_id|
  EmailWorker.perform_async(current_user.email, @start_date, @end_date, options)
end
{% endhighlight %}

Turning this into a batch is as simple as:
{% highlight ruby %}
batch = Sidekiq::Batch.new
batch.jobs do
  selected_people.pluck(:id).each do |person_id|
    EmailWorker.perform_async(current_user.email, @start_date, @end_date, options)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Batches come with two types of [callbacks](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Batches#callbacks):

- **success** - when all jobs in the batch have completed successfully.
- **complete** - when all jobs in the batch have run once, successful or not.

We enable inline mode in `sidekiq.rb` to avoid having to run [Redis](http://redis.io/) and a Sidekiq process at all times in development.

> inline mode runs the job immediately instead of enqueuing it

{% highlight ruby %}
# sidekiq.rb
if Rails.env.development?
  require 'sidekiq/testing'
  Sidekiq::Testing.inline!
end
{% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately, batch callbacks have to be called manually in [test modes](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Testing#testing-batches). Instead of creating a bunch of conditionals, we can wrap our previous code so batches are created when Sidekiq is running and run immediately in inline mode.

{% highlight ruby %}
in_batch do
  selected_people.pluck(:id).each do |person_id|
    EmailWorker.perform_async(current_user.email, @start_date, @end_date, options)
  end
end

def in_batch
  return yield if defined?(Sidekiq::Testing)
  batch = Sidekiq::Batch.new
  batch.on(:success, BatchSuccessHandler)
  batch.jobs do
    yield
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Optionally add an environment variable to easily toggle inline mode.

{% highlight ruby %}
# sidekiq.rb
if Rails.env.development?
  unless ENV["ENABLE_SIDEKIQ"]
    require 'sidekiq/testing'
    Sidekiq::Testing.inline!
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}


Now you can have your jobs run with a Sidekiq instance if you start your server with `ENABLE_SIDEKIQ=1 bundle exec rails s`.

#### Progress Bar

The other half is giving the user a progress bar. Create a route that points to either a controller or interactor that can look up [batch status](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Batches#status). Could be something similar to `/api/batch/status/:bid`. The important part is to return percentage finished to the browser.
{% highlight ruby %}
def progress
  status = Sidekiq::Batch::Status.new(bid)
  unless status.nil?
    unsent = status.pending + status.failures
    percent_complete = percent_complete(status.total, unsent)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Our app has a `Message` model that the browser polls for every minute. Polling ramps up to every 3 seconds when any batches are in progress.

[progressbar.js](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/progressbar.js) is an easy, lightweight way to create progress bars in javascript.

Here is the piece of the `coffescript` file that updates progress:

{% highlight coffeescript %}
# Create an array to keep track of multiple batch progress bars
progressCircles = []

# Initializes new progress circles
initializeProgress: (id, progressPercent) ->
 progressCircles[id] = new ProgressBar.Circle("#progress-circle-#{id}",
   color: "#83c7c7"
   strokeWidth: 3
   trailWidth: 1
   duration: 1500
   text: value: '0'
   step: (state, bar) ->
     bar.setText (bar.value() * 100).toFixed(0)
 )

# Updates or creates progress circles with new percentage
updateProgress: (id, progressPercent) ->
  initializeProgress(id, progressPercent) unless @progressCircles[id]?
  progressCircles[id].animate (progressPercent / 100)
{% endhighlight %}

This post is a quick snapshot of how we use batches to improve our customer's experience when sending emails. This just scratches the surface of what's possible.
